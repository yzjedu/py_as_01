    '''This program Computes the amount of paint needed one more'''
    # Step 1: Ask the user for the dimensions of the room
    # The three dimensions are length - height - width 


    # Step 2: Compute the total area of the four walls and ceiling
    # Area of walls = 2 * (length * height + width * height)
   
    # Area of ceiling = length * width
   
    # Total area = Area of walls + Area of ceiling


    # Step 3: Calculate the amount of primer and paint needed
    # Primer coverage = 200 square feet per gallon
    
    # Paint coverage = 350 square feet per gallon


    # Step 4: Output the total area and the amount of primer and paint needed
    # Uncomment the three lines below for the output
    # print(f"Total area to be painted: {total_area:.2f} square feet")
    # print(f"Amount of primer needed: {primer_needed:.2f} gallons")
    # print(f"Amount of paint needed: {paint_needed:.2f} gallons")
